Some key points about the TM6:\\n\\n- It is a kitchen appliance intended for preparing food in domestic households.\\n\\n- It is designed to be used only by adults, not children, even with adult supervision. Children should be kept away from it due to dangers like heat/steam, hot surfaces, etc.\\n\\n- It is not intended for deep frying foods.\\n\\n- It can be used by persons with reduced physical, sensory or mental capabilities if they are properly supervised and understand the hazards.\\n\\n- It has basic cooking functions like weighing ingredients, mixing, heating, etc. \\n\\n- It has Wi-Fi connectivity capabilities that allow setting up a network connection.\\n\\nSo in summary, the TM6 is Thermomix's latest model of a versatile countertop appliance that combines heating and blending functions to prepare various foods, with smart connectivity features. It is an all-in-one food processor designed for convenient home cooking.\"}"

      "\n",
      "Preparing the Ramekins:\n",
      "1. Brush the soufflé ramekins or molds with softened butter, applying it in upward vertical strokes. Make sure to cover the rims as well.\n",
      "2. Chill the ramekins for a few minutes, then repeat with a second layer of butter.\n",
      "3. Sprinkle some grated chocolate (or other coating like flour) into each mold, shaking to cover the inside completely. Tap out any excess.\n",
      "4. Chill the prepared ramekins until needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making the Soufflé Base:\n",
      "1. Follow the recipe for the soufflé base, making a thick, velvety mixture by cooking milk/cream, sugar, egg yolks, and flours together.\n",
      "2. Allow the base to cool to room temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whipping the Egg Whites:\n",
      "1. Whisk the egg whites until they hold stiff peaks.\n",
      "2. Add a few drops of lemon juice to stabilize the whites, then whisk again.\n",
      "3. Gradually add the remaining sugar, a spoonful at a time, whisking constantly until very thick and glossy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Folding and Baking:\n",
      "1. Whisk any zests/flavorings into the soufflé base.\n",
      "2. Whisk in 1/3 of the whipped egg whites to loosen the base.\n",
      "3. Gently fold in the remaining whipped whites with a metal spoon until evenly distributed.\n",
      "4. Fill the prepared ramekins to the top with the soufflé mixture. \n",
      "5. Tap each ramekin once on the counter to remove air bubbles.\n",
      "6. Run your finger around the inside edge to separate the mixture from the dish.\n",
      "7. Bake at 200°C/400°F for 15-20 minutes until risen with a slight wobble in the center.\n",
      "8. Dust with powdered sugar and serve immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key points are properly preparing the ramekins, gently folding in the whipped egg whites, and baking at the right temperature until just set. Following Ramsay's techniques should help you achieve tall, impressive soufflés.\n"
