The most common automated blood pressure measurement technique is based on the oscillometric method. Fully automated oscillometric measurement has been available since 1981. This principle has recently been used to measure blood pressure with a smartphone. Measuring pressure invasively, by penetrating the arterial wall to take the measurement, is much less common and usually restricted to a hospital setting. Novel methods to measure blood pressure without penetrating the arterial wall, and without applying any pressure on patient\\'s body are being explored, for example, cuffless measurements that uses only optical sensors.\\nIn office blood pressure measurement, terminal digit preference is common. According to one study, approximately 40% of recorded measurements ended with the digit zero, whereas \"without bias, 10%–20% of measurements are expected to end in zero\"\\n\\n\\n== In animals ==\\nBlood pressure levels in non-human mammals may vary depending on the species. Heart rate differs markedly, largely depending on the size of the animal (larger animals have slower heart rates). The giraffe has a distinctly high arterial pressure of about 190 mm Hg, enabling blood perfusion through the 2 metres (6 ft 7 in)-long neck to the head. In other species subjected to orthostatic blood pressure, such as arboreal snakes, blood pressure is higher than in non-arboreal snakes. A heart near to the head (short heart-to-head distance) and a long tail with tight integument favor blood perfusion to the head.\\nAs in humans, blood pressure in animals differs by age, sex, time of day, and environmental circumstances: measurements made in laboratories or under anesthesia may not be representative of values under free-living conditions. Rats, mice, dogs and rabbits have been used extensively to study the regulation of blood pressure.\\n\\n\\n=== Hypertension in cats and dogs ===\\nHypertension in cats and dogs is generally diagnosed if the blood pressure is greater than 150 mm Hg (systolic), although sight hounds have higher blood pressures than most other dog breeds; a systolic pressure greater than 180 mmHg is considered abnormal in these dogs.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nHistory of hypertension\\n\\n\\n== References ==', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=29453, end_char_idx=31857, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), waist circumference in excess of 1,020 mm (40 in) for men and 880 mm (35 in) for (non-pregnant) women is considered to imply a high risk for type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease CVD. Waist circumference can be a better indicator of obesity-related disease risk than BMI. For example, this is the case in populations of Asian descent and older people. 940 mm (37 in) for men and 800 mm (31 in) for women has been stated to pose \"higher risk\", with the NIH figures \"even higher\".\\nWaist-to-hip circumference ratio has also been used, but has been found to be no better than waist circumference alone, and more complicated to measure.\\nA related indicator is waist circumference divided by height. A 2013 study identified critical threshold values for waist-to-height ratio according to age, with consequent significant reduction in life expectancy if exceeded. These are: 0.5 for people under 40 years of age, 0.5 to 0.6 for people aged 40–50, and 0.6 for people over 50 years of age.\\n\\n\\n=== Surface-based body shape index ===\\nThe Surface-based Body Shape Index (SBSI) is far more rigorous and is based upon four key measurements: the body surface area (BSA), vertical trunk circumference (VTC), waist circumference (WC) and height (H). Data on 11,808 subjects from the National Health and Human Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 1999–2004, showed that SBSI outperformed BMI, waist circumference, and A Body Shape Index (ABSI), an alternative to BMI.\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          S\\n          B\\n          S\\n          I\\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              (\\n              \\n                \\n                  H\\n                \\n                \\n                  7\\n                  \\n                    /\\n                  \\n                  4\\n                \\n              \\n              )\\n              (\\n              \\n                \\n                  WC\\n                \\n                \\n                  5\\n                  \\n                    /\\n                  \\n                  6\\n                \\n              \\n              )\\n            \\n            BSA VTC\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathrm {SBSI} ={\\\\frac {({\\\\text{H}}^{7/4})({\\\\text{WC}}^{5/6})}{\\\\text{BSA VTC}}}}\\n  \\n\\nA simplified, dimensionless form of SBSI, known as SBSI*, has also been developed.\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          S\\n          B\\n          S\\n          \\n            I\\n            \\n              ⋆\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              (\\n              \\n                \\n                  H\\n                \\n                \\n                  2\\n                \\n              \\n              )\\n              (\\n              \\n                WC\\n              \\n              )\\n            \\n            BSA VTC\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathrm {SBSI^{\\\\star }} ={\\\\frac {({\\\\text{H}}^{2})({\\\\text{WC}})}{\\\\text{BSA VTC}}}}\\n  \\n\\n\\n=== Modified body mass index ===\\nWithin some medical contexts, such as familial amyloid polyneuropathy, serum albumin is factored in to produce a modified body mass index (mBMI).

Development of the Coombs test in 1945, the advent of transfusion medicine, and the understanding of ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn led to discovery of more blood groups. As of October 2024, the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) recognizes 47 blood groups.\\n\\n\\n== Society and culture ==\\n\\nA popular pseudoscientific belief in Eastern Asian countries (especially in Japan and South Korea) known as 血液型 ketsuekigata / hyeoraekhyeong is that a person\\'s ABO blood type is predictive of their personality, character, and compatibility with others. Researchers have established no scientific basis exists for blood type personality categorization, and studies have found no \"significant relationship between personality and blood type, rendering the theory \\'obsolete\\' and concluding that no basis exists to assume that personality is anything more than randomly associated with blood type.\"\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nBlood type (non-human)\\nHuman leukocyte antigen\\nhh blood group\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nDean, Laura (2005).

Research into the causes of this state is relatively limited, but some studies suggest a link with depression, cancer, and cerebral hemorrhage. In general, the low cholesterol levels seem to be a consequence, rather than a cause, of an underlying illness. A genetic defect in cholesterol synthesis causes Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome, which is often associated with low plasma cholesterol levels. Hyperthyroidism, or any other endocrine disturbance which causes upregulation of the LDL receptor, may result in hypocholesterolemia.\\n\\n\\n=== Testing ===\\nThe American Heart Association recommends testing cholesterol every 4–6 years for people aged 20 years or older. A separate set of American Heart Association guidelines issued in 2013 indicates that people taking statin medications should have their cholesterol tested 4–12 weeks after their first dose and then every 3–12 months thereafter. For men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65, a cholesterol test should occur every 1–2 years, and for seniors over age 65, an annual test should be performed.\\nA blood sample after 12-hours of fasting is taken by a healthcare professional from an arm vein to measure a lipid profile for a) total cholesterol, b) HDL cholesterol, c) LDL cholesterol, and d) triglycerides. Results may be expressed as \"calculated\", indicating a calculation of total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides.\\nCholesterol is tested to determine for \"normal\" or \"desirable\" levels if a person has a total cholesterol of 5.2 mmol/L or less (200 mg/dL), an HDL value of more than 1 mmol/L (40 mg/dL, \"the higher, the better\"), an LDL value of less than 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL), and a triglycerides level of less than 1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dL). Blood cholesterol in people with lifestyle, aging, or cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, family history of coronary artery disease, or angina, are evaluated at different levels.\\n\\n\\n== Interactive pathway map ==\\nClick on genes, proteins and metabolites below to link to respective articles.  \\n\\n\\n== Cholesteric liquid crystals ==\\nSome cholesterol derivatives (among other simple cholesteric lipids) are known to generate the liquid crystalline \"cholesteric phase\". The cholesteric phase is, in fact, a chiral nematic phase, and it changes colour when its temperature changes. This makes cholesterol derivatives useful for indicating temperature in liquid-crystal display thermometers and in temperature-sensitive paints.\\n\\n\\n== Stereoisomers ==\\n\\nCholesterol has 256 stereoisomers that arise from its eight stereocenters, although only two of the stereoisomers have biochemical significance (nat-cholesterol and ent-cholesterol, for natural and enantiomer, respectively), and only one occurs naturally (nat-cholesterol).\\n\\n\\n== Additional images ==\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n Media related to Cholesterol at Wikimedia Commons', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=29922, end_char_idx=33174, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Often, the stigma stems from the idea that diabetes (particularly Type 2 diabetes) resulted from poor lifestyle and unhealthy food choices rather than other causal factors like genetics and social determinants of health. Manifestation of stigma can be seen throughout different cultures and contexts. Scenarios include diabetes statuses affecting marriage proposals, workplace-employment, and social standing in communities.\\nStigma is also seen internally, as people with diabetes can also have negative beliefs about themselves. Often these cases of self-stigma are associated with higher diabetes-specific distress, lower self-efficacy, and poorer provider-patient interactions during diabetes care.\\n\\n\\n=== Racial and economic inequalities ===\\nRacial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected with higher prevalence of diabetes compared to non-minority individuals. While US adults overall have a 40% chance of developing type 2 diabetes, Hispanic/Latino adults chance is more than 50%. African Americans also are much more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes compared to White Americans. Asians have increased risk of diabetes as diabetes can develop at lower BMI due to differences in visceral fat compared to other races. For Asians, diabetes can develop at a younger age and lower body fat compared to other groups. Additionally, diabetes is highly underreported in Asian American people, as 1 in 3 cases are undiagnosed compared to the average 1 in 5 for the nation.\\nPeople with diabetes who have neuropathic symptoms such as numbness or tingling in feet or hands are twice as likely to be unemployed as those without the symptoms.\\nIn 2010, diabetes-related emergency room (ER) visit rates in the United States were higher among people from the lowest income communities (526 per 10,000 population) than from the highest income communities (236 per 10,000 population). Approximately 9.4% of diabetes-related ER visits were for the uninsured.\\n\\n\\n=== Naming ===\\nThe term \"type 1 diabetes\" has replaced several former terms, including childhood-onset diabetes, juvenile diabetes, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Likewise, the term \"type 2 diabetes\" has replaced several former terms, including adult-onset diabetes, obesity-related diabetes, and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Beyond these two types, there is no agreed-upon standard nomenclature.\\nDiabetes mellitus is also occasionally known as \"sugar diabetes\" to differentiate it from diabetes insipidus.\\n\\n\\n== Other animals ==\\n\\nDiabetes can occur in mammals or reptiles. Birds do not develop diabetes because of their unusually high tolerance for elevated blood glucose levels.\\nIn animals, diabetes is most commonly encountered in dogs and cats. Middle-aged animals are most commonly affected. Female dogs are twice as likely to be affected as males, while according to some sources, male cats are more prone than females. In both species, all breeds may be affected, but some small dog breeds are particularly likely to develop diabetes, such as Miniature Poodles.\\nFeline diabetes is strikingly similar to human type 2 diabetes. The Burmese, Russian Blue, Abyssinian, and Norwegian Forest cat breeds are at higher risk than other breeds. Overweight cats are also at higher risk.\\nThe symptoms may relate to fluid loss and polyuria, but the course may also be insidious. Diabetic animals are more prone to infections. The long-term complications recognized in humans are much rarer in animals. The principles of treatment (weight loss, oral antidiabetics, subcutaneous insulin) and management of emergencies (e.g. ketoacidosis) are similar to those in humans.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nOutline of diabetes\\nDiabetic foot\\nBlood glucose monitoring\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nAmerican Diabetes Association\\nIDF Diabetes Atlas\\nNational Diabetes Education Program\\nADA\\'s Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 2019\\nPolonsky KS (October 2012). \"The past 200 years in diabetes\".

Quitting smoking or avoiding it altogether is crucial to mitigate these potential health hazards and associated economic burdens.\n",
